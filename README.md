## About Me
👋 Hello! I'm Abhigna Ramineni, a cloud security engineer and network security specialist focused on securing cloud-native environments, building scalable threat detection systems, and protecting enterprise infrastructure at scale.

☁️ Cloud Security Engineer: Specialized in Microsoft Azure security architecture with hands-on experience in Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, Logic Apps, and cloud infrastructure hardening. Led $3.5M cloud security transformation project, implementing zero-trust principles and automated security workflows across multi-cloud environments.

🌐 Network Security Specialist: Expert in network traffic analysis, protocol security, and network-level threat detection. Analyzed traffic patterns across 20+ labs using Wireshark, developed custom secure communication protocols with SSL/TLS, and engineered detection algorithms leveraging IDS/IPS telemetry to enhance network exposure risk quantification by 35%.

🛡️ Security Operations Analyst: Building automated threat detection and response systems that protect cloud and on-premises environments. Leveraging SIEM platforms and SOAR orchestration to identify and respond to threats with 75% faster response times while reducing organizational risk exposure by 30%.

🔍 Threat Intelligence & Hunting Specialist: Advanced threat hunting operations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, uncovering 10+ adversary TTPs across cloud and network infrastructure. Conducting in-depth analysis of 500+ monthly security incidents with focus on cloud misconfigurations, network anomalies, and lateral movement detection.

🚀 DevSecOps & Security Automation Expert: Developed scalable risk assessment workflows using Azure Logic Apps, Python APIs, and KQL, improving threat prioritization accuracy by 40%. Experienced in CI/CD pipeline security integration, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security, and automated compliance validation.

🤖 Cloud Infrastructure Automation: Spearheaded enterprise-scale EDR deployment across cloud and hybrid environments using Intune, SCCM, and Ansible. Built automated security workflows correlating telemetry across 10+ cloud and network sources for dynamic asset risk assessment and continuous security monitoring.

🎓 Graduate Researcher: Advancing network security research at UMBC, developing Dockerized security testing protocols for secure communication evaluation. Delivered comprehensive lab assessments covering routing protocols, encryption standards, VPN configurations, and network segmentation strategies.
