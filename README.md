About Me

👩‍💻 Hello! I'm Abhigna Ramineni, a Cloud, Network & Security Engineer passionate about building secure, scalable, and intelligent infrastructure. My work blends networking fundamentals, cloud platforms, and modern security operations to protect systems at scale.

🔐 Security Engineering & SOC Expertise: Former Security Engineer at PwC, where I automated risk scoring, built detection logic, and led threat-hunting operations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, improving detection accuracy and reducing response times by 75%.

☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure Security: Hands-on experience securing environments across AWS, Azure, and GCP, including deploying Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and hardening enterprise cloud architectures within multi-million-dollar client projects.

🌐 Network Analysis & Protocol Engineering: Built secure communication systems using TCP sockets and performed deep packet inspection with Wireshark across 20+ labs, validating and remediating 50+ vulnerabilities with a 95% success rate.

📊 Threat Intelligence & Detection Engineering: Designed security analytics in Microsoft Sentinel with Python and KQL, created intelligence reports for leadership, and analyzed hundreds of incidents monthly to drive real-world defense strategies.

⚙️ Automation & Engineering Mindset: Built Python-powered security pipelines, Dockerized lab environments, and IaC-driven workflows to scale detection, response, and auditing processes in enterprise environments.
